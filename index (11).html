        <p class="greeting">Dear brothers,</p>
        <p>
            It is a duty upon all of us to contribute financially towards buying a ball for the tournament 
            (<strong>if you are capable of it</strong>). This contribution may not be seen as optional but 
            an obligation upon every member of our <strong>Jema'a</strong> (whether you play or not).
            Furthermore, participation in the upcoming tournament is highly encouraged, as absence from such events 
            may be perceived as separation, potentially affecting the unity and solidarity among us as classmates 
            as well as our batch.
        </p>
        <p>
            So let us all participate in our shared responsibility and uphold the values of engagement.
        </p>
        <p class="dua">جزاكم الله خيرًا</p>
